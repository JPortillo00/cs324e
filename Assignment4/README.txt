The animation for the eyes can be altered by changing the control points(float c...), vertices(x,y), and their corresponding wiggle variables(xwig,ywig).
The color can be set before the eyes are instanced. 
the stars and morphs can be modified via vertices and rotation speed.
The streaking can be altered to occur more or less frequently and the color pallete can be modified.

To see the base animation, extract the zip file and run the homework4.pde file.
