Project description

The intended animation was a recreation of the hypnotoad charachter from Futurama. The included classes are responsible for dynamic eyes(Shrineil Patel), streaking colors(Jairo Portillo Jr.), and morphing stars(Sean O'Neal), all of which have random elements.
The eyes had a few difficulties in controlling the range of pupil motion through altering a bezier curve. Through trial and error the current balance was chosen. 
There were some problems with colors shifting innappropriately, but instancing a fill command along with a colormode set to RGB fixed it.
