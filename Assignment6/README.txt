Run the file group_12_assignment6.pde in Processing.
When the window opens, there are two buttons at the top of the screen for interactivity.
These change the input pure state.
The two buttons give the states of the two qubits.
Black means the qubit is in state |0>, and white means state |1>.
Together these two buttons give the states |00>, |01>, |10>, and |11>.
These four states are represented graphically as red rectangles in the first column of the output below the buttons.
Pressing the buttons will update the simulation to run the quantum computer again applied to the new input.
The intermediate states after each quantum logic gate are given by each column.
The final state is the rightmost column, again a linear combination of the four basis states.
Color gives the phase / angle in the complex plane, and brightness gives the magnitude.
