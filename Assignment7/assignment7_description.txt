This is a rendition of the classic arcade game bubble break. The
player shoots a variety of colored balls and when 3 match, they pop.The objective is to remove all the 
bubbles on the screen. You lose when the un-popped bubbles reach the bottom of the screen. There is sfx for popping
as well as a background track of the mortal combat theme song. Menu implementation was from Jairo, the game logic and 
functionality primarily came from Sean, and Shrineil did the sfx and sound. Sound implementation was difficult due to 
volume control issues with the minim library as well as beads. The default library was used as it was much 
easier to implement. The menu was also a bit finicky and getting it to stay one screen through the games framerate was
difficult. The logic of the game used a grid to detect hits as well as a six point system to test connections. The 
code was slightly inneffiecient but overall a smooth experience.
